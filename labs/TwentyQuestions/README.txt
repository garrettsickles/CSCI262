1.	No Collaborators
2.	The major challenge I had in this project was ammending the binary tree for new questions and answers.
3.	I liked the entire project. It was a fun way to work with binary trees. The thing I liked least was the limited size of the tree but if I wanted to I could have expanded it.
4.	In total, I spent about 3 hours working on the assignment.
