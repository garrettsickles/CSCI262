2.	Things I liked about this lab:
		-We had a lot of freedom to work with in solving the problem
		-Using a GUI is worth the effort
		-This type of application is relevant to my daily life
		-This lab encouraged creativity
		-This type of project made me think in an abstract way
		-The extra credit oppurtunity
	Things I disliked about this lab:
		-I did not enjoy how abruptly we were introduced to the GUI
		-It would have been nice to discuss the background information more indepth
3.	I spent around 25 hours on this assignment
4.	My book recommender app allows users to add and delete users and books, save these changes to disk, and uses an algorithm with weighting to calculate the highest recommended books.
	I added many features to my GUI to enhance the user experience. Users, Books, and ratings are all dynamic and can be added or deleted from the menu bar.
	The GUI's recommendation box also displays the similarity product (unitless), so the reader knows precisely the order of the top poitively recommended books.
 	The book list also can be sorted alphabetically by title or author.
	My book recommender app uses a dynamic mapping to model the relationship between books, readers, and the respective ratings.
	Books know who has read them, and readers know which books they have read and how they rated them, and nodes can be inserted or deleted dynamically.
	This allows a user to easily compare himself to readers who have read the same book, and depending on how similarly they rated a book, weight his/her recommendations appropriately.
	
	Developiong this model was very challenging but after many iterations I had developed a model I was satisfied with.
	I also had trouble finding an approprate wxWidgets feature to complete the task I needed at certain instances, but their is comprehensive online documentation so I eventually suceeded.
