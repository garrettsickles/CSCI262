Recommendation Algorithm Enhancements:
-Algorithm cycles through all the books I have read, comparing me to any other user that has read the same book.
-A weighting factor for each comparison is created. It is equal to my rating of the book multiplied by the other user's rating.
-If this factor is greater than 0, I add all the books they have rated into a map containing books and the sum of all their weighted ratings. If the book already is in the map, the book's weighted rating is added to the previous value.
-The map is then loaded into a stack, with the best match on top and the worst at the back, and returned to the user

Class Structure Enhancements:
-I created a library class which handles the dynamic mapping of books, readers, and their respective ratings and also analyzes the dynamic map to get book recomendations for users
-I created a book and a reader class to help conceptualize how the dynamic map functions
